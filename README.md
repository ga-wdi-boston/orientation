# Web Development Immersive Orientation

## Welcome to Web Developement Immersive

We are super excited to have you as part of our flagship program here at General
Assembly! This README will provide all the information you will need to be
successfully oriented into the Web Development Immersive Program.

## Before we get started

Please be sure that your computer is up-to-date with the most recent version of
your operating system.

### OS X

Please upgrade to the latest version of OS X, Sierra (10.12).

### Windows or Linux

General Assembly no longer officially supports Windows or Linux in immersive
programs. If you have a Windows or a Linux machine, you should contact your
Immersive Producer. Instructors may provide support for these operating systems
 at their own discretion.

If you are on a Windows machine, you **must** set up your computer to dual-boot
Linux Ubuntu before you can get started.  ***Running a VM will not do!***

*Times and Events are subject to change*

## Consultant Team Introductions

Throughout the Web Development Immersive program, you will have a dedicated team
of Consultants provide you with training, support and direction. During this
portion of Orientation you can expect to learn:

-   Names of the consultant team members
-   How long they have been with General Assembly
-   What they were doing prior to General Assembly
-   Learn an interesting fact or guilty pleasure from each
-   Learn their favorite applications and why

## Icebreakers

During this portion of orientation, we will begin to break the 'ice' and get
to know eachother a bit better!

### Two Truth's and a Lie

Here's how to play:

-   Write 3 interesting facts on the lined side of a 3x5 index card
-   Two of the facts are **true** and one of the facts will be a **lie**
-   Keep in mind that the lie should be believable like a truth and the truths
could be lies
-   Cards are collected, shuffled and passed back out
-   'Johnny' starts and reads the facts on the card he holds
-   'Johnny' has 2 guesses to indentify the person whos card he's holding
-   After 2 guess, if 'Johnny' is not correct, 'Jane' shares that it's her card
-   'Johnny' now has 2 guesses to try and pick the fact that is the **lie**
-   'Johnny' highlights which fact is the **lie** and 'Jane' on blank side of
the index card
-   'Jane' goes next and reads the facts on the card she holds
-   This continues until everyone has played!

## Alumni Panel

Let's be honest, deciding to make the life changing decision to enroll in this
full-time immersive program, most likely came with some questions and possible
doubt. This portion of orientation will give you the opportunity to hear from
alumni from past Web Development Immersive programs. You can expect to hear:

-   Names of each alumni panelist and what they were doing before WDI
-   What the alumni do now after successfully completing the program
-   What their experience was like in WDI
-   What some the challenges were that they faced during their cohorts
-   What was something they wish they knew at the start of the program
-   Open the floor up for questions

Example questions to ask:

-   What do you wish someone had told you? Would you have believed it?
-   How long was the gap in time between learning something and feeling
comfortable using it?
-   What is your learning process on-the-job?
-   How important were the projects for your learning and comfort?
-   What was it like day-to-day and week-to-week during the program?
-   How did you convince someone that you can do the job even though you
don't have experience?
-   What was your highest level of education? Did your degree matter?

## Consultant Q&A

You just heard from various WDI alumni, now is your opportunity
to ask the Consultant team questions you'd like answered. From each
Consultant, you can expect to hear:

-   More about their background and journey
-   How they began their careers in web development
-   The biggest challenge they had in starting their careers
-   Projects they've worked on

Here are some example questions you should ask:

-   What do you believe the key to success is in this program?
-   What is your personality and communication style?
-   How do I keep a positive attitude when things seem impossible?
-   Any words of wisdom before we begin this journey?

## Program Roadmap

## Expectations & Policies

We take great pride in our Web Development Immersive program! A main reason why
our program is so successful is due to **very** clear expectations and policies
we have in place. You will find these below.

First and foremost, to be successful in this program, it is **imperative** that
you understand what a **_Growth Mindset_** is and have one!

![Growth Mindset Chart](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/388761/21698706/4c6a08d8-d366-11e6-8758-8bf63f65fe60.jpg)

**GROWTH MINDSET DIAGRAM**

![Growth Mindset](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8379295/15218249/feed4808-182c-11e6-8c62-4ce78903bee9.png)

**MUST WATCH** [The power of belief: Mindset & Success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc)

**Please Note** : The goal of the program is not to produce working code,
working code is a by-product of the goal. The goal of the program is to learn
how to create working code.

### Diagnostics

-   Diagnostics will be given regularly, and are designed to reflect
recently-covered material
-   These diagnostics scores will not impact your completion; they are a tool
for you and us to gauge your comprehension of the material
-   **Don't stress out about these diagnostics, and don't obsess over the
results**

### Practice

-   Practice will be assigned semi-regularly, and will be assessed in terms of:

    -   Code quality (e.g. indentation, good comments, readability, etc.)
    -   Functionality (Does it run correctly? Is it robust? Is it efficient?)

-   However, as important as doing your practice work is, remember that the
most important thing is what you're learning.

### Professionalism

-   We will treat you like adults and expect you to behave like adults.
-   Disagreements with other students should be resolved on your own.
-   As with every rule, there are exceptions. If any student is behaving in a
way that is disrespectful and/or dangerous towards their fellow developers,
that should be brought to the producer's attention immediately. Similarly,
any issues that involved consultants should be brought to the producer's
attention immediately
-   Please see the 'Code of Conduct' portion of your student enrollment
agreement if you have questions about this

### Independence

-   We will do our best to train you with everything we can in the time we have.
 However, the ultimate responsibility for what you learn lies with **YOU**.
-   If you're having trouble with material, ask questions. See out consultants
outside of class. Find extra tutorials online.
-   If you're ahead, ask for more work!

### Attendance

#### Late arrivals and Early departures

-   If you arrive after **9:00am** you are late. Any
training missed is your responsibility to make up.
-   If you are not present at the beginning of afternoon announcements, or if you leave before **5:00pm**, you will accrue one early departure.
-   If your late arrivals and early departures exceed **5**, you will not
successfully complete the program.

#### Absences

-   If you miss more than **3** days regardless of reason, you will not
successfully complete the program

-   If you know of a planned absence(s), please contract a producer ASAP

### Successful Completion Requirements

-   Program Attendance
-   Successful completion of **ALL** projects
-   Submission of all Assignments
-   Outcomes Programming Attendance
-   Outcomes Programming Participation

### Rewards for Successful Completion

-   Post-graduation outcomes support
-   Participation in the Meet & Hire
-   Letter and Certificate of Completion
-   Participation in sem-anual Graduation Celebration
-   You may also request a reference or recommendation from Consultants

## Workspace Culture

Break into groups of three or four. In your group, discuss and outline your
expectations of each other as colleagues. Then, we'll share what each group has
discussed and record a social contract.

Most groups of developers come up with something like the following:

-   Respect is mutually given, not earned; follow [Wheaton's
    Law](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law)
-   Be an open communicator; do not disengage when working in a group, and
    practice active listening.
-   Be open to constructive feedback; when giving feedback, be specific.
-   Take others' intent into account; follow [Hanlon's
    Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor).
-   Be collaborative, share freely, and respect others' abilities and
    preferences.
-   Maintain a growth mindset and a good attitude.
-   Ask lots of questions, but do your due diligence!
-   Leave outside stress and your ego at the door.
-   Foster a space where it safe to fail and learn from mistakes.
-   Have fun!

## Staff Introductions

Majority of your experiences in the program workspace will have you interact
with the consultants, production, outcomes and operations teams. However, there
are additional departments working hard, behind the scenes, to ensure your
experience along with that of future programs are the best they possibly can be.

This portion will allow you to meet some additional friendly faces that you will
see around campus. This includes:

-   Senior Leadership
-   Marketing
-   Partnerships
-   Classes, Events & Workshops
-   Admissions
-   Product
-   Other Immersive Programs Teams

## Operations

We want to ensure that you have the best experience possible during your time in
WDI! One of the key components to ensure outstanding student experiences is our
Operations team.

Who makes up our Operations team? Our **Campus Commander** and
**Front-Lines** staff.

The Operations team is responsible for so many crucial parts of our campus and
programs, that we cannot list them all, but here are several things you could go
to them for:

-   Adjusting the temperature of the workspace
-   Conference room bookings
-   Printing
-   Office supplies
-   Loaner computer
-   And many more!

Since we are in a co-working space called, WeWork, there are some additional
amenities you'll have access to. But first, we should define what our
relationship with WeWork looks like. We rent out our 4 workspace rooms from
WeWork. What this means is that we **do not own** WeWork **nor** does WeWork own
General Assembly! Here are area's that you'll have access to, but are not
**_exclusive_** to General Assembly students or staff:

-   The Dugout
-   Kitchen areas
-   Floors 1, 2, 6, 7 (This includes kitchens, conference rooms, phone
booths, etc. on those floors)

How do I get access to these amenities you might ask. You have to provide three
pieces of information to our Campus Commander:

-   Picture of your Photo I.D. / Identification
-   Picture of you, shoulder up, with a white background (Selfie)
-   First Name, Last Name and Email Address

Once the Campus Commander has these three items **_FROM EVERYONE_**, access
cards will be created and handed out. **PLEASE NOTE** No one will receive their
access card until all information is collected!

We will be collecting these access cards on your final day of the program.

## Outcomes

One of the most valuable resources and benefits from participating in an
Immersive Program at General Assembly is our Outcomes Team. Upon successful
completion of the Web Development Immersive Program, you will have access to
this great resourse! During this segment, you will have a chance to hear from
you Outcomes Producer and to get a high level snapshot of what you can expect
for Outcomes throughout the course.

You will have much more information provided during your first Outcomes
Programming session, so do not worry if every question you have is not answered
during this segment!

## Installfest

Follow these instructions to set up your laptop for work in WDI. If you've
previously set up a development environment on your computer, you may wish to
skip some of these steps; **do not do so** without first checking with an
consultant!

If at any point you are unsure of whether you have done something correctly,
ask a consultant. It's important in many cases that we do these steps in order.

## Atom

The text editor we'll be using in this course is called **Atom**; it was
developed by the GitHub team, and is highly extensible.

***Note: From this point forward you will open Atom from the command line***

### OS X & Linux

Download Atom from [Atom.io](https://atom.io/)

### Linux ONLY

Once finished run the following command:

```bash
# Linux Only
sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb
```

### Atom Shell commands

Once Atom is successfully downloaded, open it and in the 'Atom' menu item, click
on 'install shell commands' to install the necessary toolkit.

### Atom Add-Ons

We're going to use Atom's package manager, `apm`, to add a number of helpful
extensions to your Atom installation. For each package listed below, run
`apm install <name-of-package>` in the terminal to perform the installation.

```bash
  apm install aligner
```

```bash
  apm install aligner-scss
```

```bash
  apm install aligner-css
```

Now that we have some practice with running 'apm install <package_name>', we can
use a shortcut that installs all packages in one go!

```bash
apm install aligner-ruby atom-beautify linter-jshint editorconfig esformatter fixmyjs git-diff-details git-history git-plus language-markdown less-than-slash linter linter-csslint linter-eslint linter-markdown linter-rubocop linter-ruby linter-scss-lint linter-tidy markdown-writer sort-lines language-ember-htmlbars
```

Part of being a good developer is using tools that help you make fewer mistakes.
To that end, let's configure a useful feature in Atom: autosave! First, let's
enable the autosave plugin.

```bash
  apm enable autosave

  # Expect the following response

  # Not Disabled:
  #    autosave
  # Please specify a package to enable
```

Next, open Atom's settings, click the packages tab, and search for autosave.
Then open the "Settings" panel for the autosave plugin.

![Atom Settings > Packages](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/388761/21697829/41986714-d362-11e6-87ac-f0c42eac72e0.png)

Lastly, ensure the "Enabled" option is checked.

![Autosave Settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/388761/21697838/47338b72-d362-11e6-9106-4a5f476945ca.png)

## Shell Configuration (OS X only)

OS X ships with utilities that are slightly different from standard Linux tools.
To smooth out *some* of the differences, we need to change how OS X loads our
shell (`bash`) configuration.

1. Make sure that a `.bashrc` file exists in your home directory. In your terminal, type:

  ```bash
  touch ~/.bashrc
  ```

2. Make sure that a `.bash_profile` file exists in your home directory. In your terminal, type:

  ```bash
  touch ~/.bash_profile
  ```

3. Bash is usually configured to load `.bashrc` from `.bash_profile`, but OS X
doesn't do this by default. So we add a command to do so. In your terminal,
type:

  ```bash
  echo 'test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```

4. Next, we'll look at `.bash_profile` to make sure it has the contents we
expect. Type the following in the terminal to look at the contents of the file:

  ```bash
  cat ~/.bash_profile
  ```

  At the bottom, you should have something that looks like this:

  ```bash
  # ~/.bash_profile

  test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
  ```

5.  Much of the software we'll be installing goes in `/usr/local/bin`, a
directory that OS X doesn't search by default. You will also need to update
`/etc/paths` to add this directory. In your terminal, type:

  ```bash
  echo '/\/usr\/local\/bin/\nd\nwq' | sudo ed /etc/paths
  echo '1i\n/usr/local/bin\n.\nwq' | sudo ed /etc/paths
  ```

6.  Finally, let's inspect our changes by typing:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/paths
  ```

It should look like this:

```bash
# /etc/paths

/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
```

## Homebrew

Those of you who are on Ubuntu may already have a powerful package manager, `apt`,
built into your operating system. However, for both OS X and Linux we'll
be installing a 3rd-party package manager called Homebrew to install software
from the command line.

### Command Line Tools

In order for Homebrew to work, we'll need to rely on a number of programs that
come pre-installed on Linux. Install these tools **via the terminal** using the
command:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

This may require that you run a Software Update before proceeding.

## Install Homebrew

- First, set permissions for `/usr/local` by entering the following command into your terminal.

```bash
chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local
```

-   Second, enter this command into your terminal:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

-   Homebrew has a built-in diagnostic tool to determine if it's working
correctly; you can run it by entering the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew doctor
```

**NOTE: YOUR SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY THROW SOME ERRORS HERE!** Some of these
errors are probably minor, but some might not be; please wait until one of the
consultants has given you the go-ahead before moving on.

-   Once Homebrew says `Your system is ready to brew`, run the following command
update Homebrew's directory of packages.

```bash
brew update
```

-   Lastly, install tidy-html5

```bash
brew install tidy-html5
```

### Installing NVM and Node/NPM

We're going to be installing Node next; Node (and its various packages) will be
the foundation of a large part of the course. First, though, we're going to
download a tool called [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) that allows us
to maintain multiple different versions of Node, in case we want to switch
between them for different projects. Then we'll download Node, and use its
associated package manager, NPM, to download and install the following Node
modules:

-   JShint, a tool for testing JavaScript code quality. (`jshint`)
-   Grunt, a tool for automating background tasks. (`grunt-cli`)

```bash
# OSX ONLY
brew install nvm
```

```bash
#LINUX ONLY
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.1/install.sh | bash
```

### OSX and Linux

**Restart your terminal (close it and reopen it; not just the window!)**

-   Open your `.bashrc` file by typing `atom ~/.bashrc` and paste in the
    following depending on your operating system:

```bash
# OSX ONLY
export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
```

```bash
#LINUX ONLY
export NVM_DIR="/home/$(whoami)/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

### OSX and Linux

-   Use NVM to install the latest longterm stable version of Node (4.4.7)

```bash
nvm install --lts=argon
nvm alias default v4
nvm use default
```

-   ***Restart your Terminal by quitting the application and re-opening it.***

-   ***AGAIN, Restart your Terminal***

-   Finally, use NPM to install the Node modules mentioned earlier and make them
    available across all of our projects.

Just like we did before with the Atom packages install, we can string
together the various packages we'd like installed into one executable
command:

```bash
npm install --global npm
npm install -g jshint jsonlint grunt-cli remark-lint jscs bower phantomjs-prebuilt
```

### Git (and GitHub)

If you haven't done so already, go to [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and create
and account; be sure to write down your username and password somewhere, since
we'll be using these credentials later.

### OS X ONLY

Enter the command:
`brew install git`

### Linux ONLY

Enter the command:
`sudo apt-get install git`

## Configuring Git

### Both OS X and Linux

Now let's take care of some settings.

-   Show the current Git branch in the terminal prompt, and tweak Git's EDITOR
variable so that commit message pop-ups open in Atom. Run the command:

```bash
atom ~/.bashrc
```

-   Paste the following code into the bottom of the file:

```bash
# Git
function parse_git_branch {
  ref=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null) || return
  echo "("${ref#refs/heads/}")"
}
export PS1="\w \$(parse_git_branch)\n\$ "
export EDITOR='atom --wait'
export VISUAL='atom --wait'
```

-   Colorize git in the command line

```bash
git config --global color.ui true
```

-   Configure Git

```bash
git config --global user.name "<yourUsername>"
git config --global user.email "<your_email@example.com>"
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
git config --global push.default simple
git config --global branch.autosetupmerge true
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

## Linking with GitHub

### Both OS X and Linux

In order to push commits to GitHub from the command line, we need Git and
GitHub to have a matching set of SSH keys.

-   Generate a new key by running

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "<your_email@example.com>"
```

(Feel free to put in a password or select a non-default location for your keys,
but it's not necessary to do so; to move ahead, just keep hitting `enter`).

-   Add this new key to your system by running:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

-   Copy the new key to your clipboard using either:

```bash
# OSX ONLY
  pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### OR

```bash
# LINUX ONLY
  xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### OSX and Linux

-   Log into GitHub.com, go to [https://github.com/settings/ssh](https://github.com/settings/ssh),
and paste in your SSH key. To test it out, type the following into the command
line:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If you get a prompt along the lines of

```bash
The authenticity of host 'github.com (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)'... can\'t be established.
RSA key fingerprint is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Just type 'yes'. If everything's working, you should get a response like the
following:

```bash
Hi yourUsername! You\'ve succesfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Last thing, now that you have git and GitHub we want this repo on your local
computer. Please follow along as I show you how to fork, clone and put the repo
in the correct directory.

-   Now that our local machine is set up with Git, we need to `fork and clone`
the [orientation repo](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/orientation). Once you
fork to your Github  account, make sure you copy the HTTPS clone link (It will
look something like `https://github.com/<your github name>/orientation.git`)

-   In your root directory `cd ~`, let's move to our downloads file by `cd
Downloads/`, then run `git clone <link copied from github>`.

-   Move into the `oritentation` directory by `cd orientation/`. Now we have to set up
a global 'excludesfile', listing all the files that we might want git to ignore.

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
cp .gitignore ~/.gitignore # from this repository directory
```

### Install [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub)

> hub is a command line tool that wraps git in order to extend it with extra
> features and commands that make working with GitHub easier. -- [`hub`
> README](https://github.com/github/hub).

#### OSX ONLY

```bash
brew install hub
```

After installing `hub`, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`.

```bash
eval "$(hub alias -s)"
```

####Linux ONLY

Paste at a Terminal prompt:

```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Linuxbrew/install/master/install)"
```

```sh
PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
```

Edit your ~/.bash_profile to add ~/.linuxbrew/bin to your PATH:

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"' >>~/.bash_profile
```

Now you need to install some setup-tools:

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git python-setuptools ruby
```

You're done! Try installing hub:

```sh
brew install hub
```

## Rbenv, Ruby, and Rails

Rbenv is a tool that we can use to manage multiple versions of Ruby and
determine which version we use for a particular project.

Before we install Rbenv we want to make sure a similar Ruby manager rvm is not
already installed and if it is then we will uninstall it.

```bash
rvm -h
# expect rvm -h to result in message 'rvm not found'
# if you do not see the message 'rvm not found' then run
rvm implode
```

1.  Install Rbenv

### OS X

```bash
# OSX ONLY
brew install rbenv
```

### Linux

Copy and paste this entire line into your terminal and run it.

```bash
# LINUX ONLY
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer/master/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
```

2.  Tell Rbenv to use homebrew's directories instead of rbenv's

### OS X ONLY

`atom ~/.bashrc` and paste in the following code ***BEFORE*** the stuff you pasted
in about Git.

```bash
#OSX ONLY
# Rbenv
if which rbenv > /dev/null; then
  export RBENV_ROOT=/usr/local/var/rbenv
  export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
  eval "$(rbenv init -)"
fi

```

### Linux

`atom ~/.bashrc` and paste in the following code BEFORE the stuff you pasted
in about Git.

```bash
#LINUX ONLY
# Rbenv
if which rbenv > /dev/null; then
  export RBENV_ROOT="${HOME}/.rbenv"
  export PATH="${RBENV_ROOT}/bin:${PATH}"
  eval "$(rbenv init -)"
fi

```

3.  Once you've done this, run the following command to reload the terminal's
settings:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

4.  ***Note: after installing gems you may need to run this command***

### OS X and Linux

```bash
rbenv rehash
```

### Linux ONLY

Rbenv on Linux depends on another library called `libffi-dev`. Download and
install it with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

5.Install `ruby-build`, a plugin for rbenv.

```bash
# OSX ONLY
brew install ruby-build
```

```bash
# LINUX ONLY
git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

Don't worry if the above step doesn't take. Some Linux machines may not need it.

### OS X and Linux

Before installing our Ruby versions, we need to confirm that rbenv has been installed correctly.

```bash
rbenv --version
# expecting message 'rbenv 1.1.0'
# if you do not get the message 'rbenv 1.1.0' refer to an instructor
```

6.Install version 2.3.1 of Ruby and make it the system-wide default using the
command:

```bash
rbenv install 2.3.1
rbenv global 2.3.1
```

You can see what versions of Ruby rbenv has downloaded by running
`rbenv versions`; to see which version you are currently using, type either
`rbenv version` or `ruby -v`.

## From Ruby to Rails (and more)

Now that you have Ruby installed, you can begin to install gems on your own.
However, gems usually come with a lot of unnecessary documentation - let's tell
Ruby to skip those by running the following command:

```bash
echo 'gem: --no-document' >> ~/.gemrc
```

Next, we'll go ahead and install Rails. ***First though, back out of the `orientation`
repo by running `cd ~`. This will move us to the root/home directory.***

```bash
gem install rails
```

Here are a couple of other gems we should also install.

```bash
gem install bundler
gem install rubocop
gem install scss_lint
```

## Postgres

Next, we'll download Postgres, a database program that we'll be using for most
of the course.

1.First, download and install Postgres.

```bash
# OSX ONLY
brew install postgres
```

Run to install Postgres and its dependencies.

```bash
# LINUX ONLY
sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev
```

2.Then, configure your new Postgres installation by entering the following
lines into the console:

### OS X ONLY

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents

ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

createdb `whoami`
```

### Linux ONLY

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser `whoami` -s

sudo -u postgres createdb `whoami`
```

> Whether you're on OS X or Linux, you can test your configuration by running
> `psql` in the console.
> To quit, type `\q`

See [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL) if you run into any issues with the installation.

3.  Finally, install the `pg` gem from the command line so that Ruby programs
can communicate with Postgres.

```bash
gem install pg
```

## Other Goodies

```bash
# OSX ONLY
brew install libsass
```

```bash
# LINUX ONLY
sudo apt-get install libsass
```

## Chrome

If you do not already have Google Chrome, download it now and set it as your
default browser.

When done do the following on any page in Chrome:

-   Press Command + option + J simultaneously to open up the Chrome inspector
-   On the top right of the inspector window there are three dots, click that.
-   Goto settings and make sure yours look like the following image.
